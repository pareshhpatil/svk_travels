Shuhaid Lambe & Vivek Iyer founded Siddhivinayak. The company originated from the thought that India is a unique business environment. Its payment and collections challenges are different. Despite the E-com boom in the country, these problems pose as a deterrent to fast adoption of E-commerce. Addressing these issues to level the playing field was at the heart of building Siddhivinayak.</p>
